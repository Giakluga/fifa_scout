**FIFA Scout** is a high-performance interactive dashboard for scouting and analyzing football players, teams, and coaches.
Built using **PySpark** for big data processing and **Streamlit** for the frontend, this application is optimized to handle large datasets with minimal latency.

## Data Source & Engineering

The original dataset is based on the **[EA Sports FC 24 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/ea-sports-fc-24-complete-player-dataset)** by **Stefano Leone**.

To ensure optimal performance with Spark, a custom **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** was developed using Python:
* **Extraction:** Sourced raw CSV files (`male_players.csv`, `male_teams.csv`, `male_coaches.csv`).
* **Transformation:** Data cleaning, type casting, and schema optimization.
* **Loading:** Converted all data into **Parquet format** to leverage columnar storage and compression, significantly reducing load times compared to standard CSVs.

> *Note: The app runs on a free cloud instance. If the app is asleep, please click to wake it up and wait about 30-60 seconds for the Spark engine to initialize.*
## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Scouting Engine
A powerful search engine allowing granular filtering of the entire database:
* **Technical Attributes:** Skills, Weak Foot, Work Rate, Positions.
* **Performance Stats:** Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, Physical.
* **Financial Data:** Market Value, Wage, Contract Expiration.
* **Team Context:** Club Rating, League, Nationality.

### 2. Player Comparison Tool
A dedicated tool to select up to 3 players and compare them side-by-side:
* **Radar Chart (Spider Plot):** Instant visual comparison of key stats using *Plotly*.
* **Technical Sheet:** Transposed data table for detailed analysis.

### 3. Optimized "No-Join" Architecture
To achieve instant search results without expensive Spark JOIN operations:
* **Lazy Loading:** Heavy data processing is triggered only upon user request.
* **Python Lookup Tables:** Instead of expensive JOIN operations in Spark, the app utilizes in-memory Python Hash Maps (Dictionaries) to enrich player data with Club, League, and Coach information in real-time.
* **Smart Caching:** Extensive use of `@st.cache_resource` and `@st.cache_data`.
